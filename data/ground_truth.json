    "comment": "Generated by Gemini 3.0 Pro acting as an expert evaluator (Teacher). This Ground Truth dataset serves as a benchmark for the 'LLM-as-a-Judge' strategy. Since the target runtime model is a smaller, resource-constrained Local LLM (Student), having high-quality, reasoning-rich answers generated by a superior model allows for robust automated evaluation of the smaller model's retrieval accuracy and generation quality."

      "question": "If the QRC fails during boot, what is the expected system behavior and recommended recovery steps?",
      "answer": "If the QRC fails, the boot sequence halts at phase 3 (AI Layer). The recommended recovery step is to disable the AI Layer autoload completely and reboot with a minimal profile, as per the Emergency Startup Procedure.",

      "question": "Explain the ambiguity around the term 'Safe Mode' and how it might affect operator decisions.",
      "answer": "The term 'Safe Mode' is ambiguous because it refers to different states depending on context and firmware version: it can mean 'Isolation Mode' (cutting communication), a 'Low-Power' state, or in firmware v3.x, a diagnostic state freezing AI decisions. This ambiguity has caused incidents where operators unintentionally left systems in unintended states.",

    {
      "id": "q3",
      "question": "What contradictions exist in network policies regarding AI outbound communication?",
      "answer": "There is a contradiction regarding Isolation Mode: some documentation states it disables all outbound traffic, while other notes claim telemetry uplinks are exempt. Additionally, firmware v3.x mistakenly allowed redundant outbound packets, contradicting the standard policy that AI modules must not initiate outbound connections without overrides.",

      "question": "Describe the procedure to manually restore communications modules if Isolation Mode was triggered.",
      "answer": "According to the Emergency Startup Procedure, if Isolation Mode was triggered, communications modules must be manually restored. This is explicitly listed as step 7 in the full procedure.",

    {
      "id": "q5",
      "question": "Who is authorized to override network restrictions, and what conflicts might arise?",
      "answer": "Only the Commander or the AI Ethics Officer are authorized to execute emergency overrides for network restrictions. However, Commander Morales is known to occasionally override AI routines, which has led to QRC conflicts in the past.",
